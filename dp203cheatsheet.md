# My Azure DP-203 Cheat Sheet
Things you need to know well for the DP-203 exam.
This is not meant to be exhaustive, just to share the most important highlights.

# Windowing functions
Just a great topic that I imagine writers of exam questions love. Here is most of what you need to know.

| Type | Contiguous? | Overlapping? | Window size | Window starts when.. | Details |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| Tumbling | Yes | No | Fixed | At fixed time | }
| Hopping | No | Yes | Fixed | Fixed | |
| Sliding | No | Yes | Fixed? | When event enters/exits | |
| Session | No | No | Variable | When first event occurs | |
| Snapshot | No | No window | N/A | N/A | Groups events that have the same timestamp |

# External tables
Important topics to know
* You need create an external data source, external file format and then you can create an external table.
* When you set LOCATION for an external table, what files are included and what won't be read? What do wildcards do? What will it do with hidden files.

## LOCATION
Suppose we have this structure:

/ webdata / mydata.txt
          / Month / mydata2.txt
          / .hiddenFolder / mydata3.txt
          / _hidden.txt

What files will be read? That depends on the used technology.

| Location definition | Type of env | Will read subdirs? | Will read hidden files? | Will read hidden dirs? |
| ------------------- | ------- | ---- | ---- | -- |
| LOCATION='/webdata' | Polybase | Yes | No | No |
| LOCATION='/webdata' | Hadoop | Yes | No | No |
| LOCATION='/webdata' | Native | No | No | No |
| LOCATION='/webdata/**' | Native | Yes | No | No |

Hidden files and folders: "Just like Hadoop, PolyBase doesn't return hidden folders. It also doesn't return files for which the file name begins with an underline (_) or a period (.)."
(PolyBase is a technology that accesses external data stored in Azure Blob storage or Azure Data Lake Store via the T-SQL language.)
